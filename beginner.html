            <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to CKKS HE</h2>

            <h3 id="what-is-he">What is HE and where is it used?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Homomorphic Encryption (HE)</strong> defines a scheme to encrypt data so that computation (such as
              multiplication and addition) can be directly performed in the encrypted format. This is known as
              <strong>encrypted computation</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Privacy-Preserving AI:</strong> HE is primarily used for sensitive applications like
                healthcare (protecting genomic data), finance (analyzing investment data), and government.</li>
              <li><strong>Security Foundation:</strong> HE is built on <strong>lattice-based cryptography</strong>,
                which is considered "post-quantum"—meaning it is secure even against future quantum computers.</li>
              <li><strong>The CKKS Scheme:</strong> This specific version of HE is designed for <strong>approximate
                  arithmetic</strong>, making it perfect for real-world tasks like AI inference and signal processing
                where slight rounding errors are acceptable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="data-representation">How is data represented after encryption?</h3>
            <p>
              To encrypt a list of numbers (a <strong>vector</strong>), we go through a process called
              <strong>Packing</strong>.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Ciphertext Structure:</strong> A single ciphertext contains a pair of two high-precision
                polynomials of degree $N$.</li>
              <li><strong>Slots and Packing:</strong> Each pair of polynomials can hold $N/2$ data elements, termed as
                <strong>"slots"</strong>. The specific way individual data is placed into these slots is called
                <strong>"packing"</strong> or <strong>"layout"</strong>.
              </li>
              <li><strong>High Precision:</strong> Each coefficient in these polynomials can be <strong>thousands of
                  bits long</strong> to ensure security, which is much larger than the 32-bit or 64-bit numbers standard
                computers use.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong> As shown in the illustration below, for $N=65536$, a vector of 32,768 data
              points is encoded into an $N$-degree polynomial and then encrypted into two polynomials of the same
              degree.
            </p>
            <img src="fig/image8.png" alt="Raw data encoding into polynomials">

            <p>
              <strong>The SIMD Mindset:</strong> Once data is encrypted, it behaves like a <strong>SIMD (Single
                Instruction, Multiple Data)</strong> machine with a massive vector length. If you add two ciphertexts,
              the computer adds all $N/2$ slots at once. This makes HE-based encrypted processing exactly work like a
              SIMD vectorized hardware, such as AVX512. And HE is analogous to an AVX&lt;N/2&gt;, e.g., AVX32768 for
              N=65536.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Allowed Operations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Addition:</strong> Slot-wise addition of two ciphertexts.</li>
              <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> Slot-wise multiplication. Note: This is computationally "expensive"
                and requires extra steps like <strong>Relinearization</strong> and <strong>Rescaling</strong> to manage
                noise and data size.</li>
              <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Moves all data in the slots left or right (e.g., move every number one slot
                to the right).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Such restriction reformulates the efficiency optimization problem as a problem of how to convert
              application into a sequence of SIMD Addition, SIMD Multiplication and SIMD rotation of a very-long vector,
              to minimize overall costs.

            <h2>Chapter 2: The HE Compilation Stack</h2>
            <p>
              To tackle this entire problem structurally, HE acceleration techniques, particularly for CKKS encryption,
              could be formally categorized into five distinct layers, including Packing, Mapping, Scheduling,
              Decomposing and Binding.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Packing</strong> defines how data is organized within ciphertext slots. Specifically, a CKKS
                ciphertext operates like a vector of SIMD units, encoding multiple data per ciphertext and enforcing
                lock-step operator for all encoded data. Thus, operators in original applications initially designed for
                element-wise computations must be transformed into SIMD-compatible, HE-specific Privacy-Preserving
                Operators (PP-Ops).</li>
              <li><strong>Mapping</strong> translates PP-Ops into sequences of fundamental HE operators. Optimal mapping
                seeks maximum arithmetic intensity, data reuse, and parallelism while minimizing computational and
                memory overhead to reduce latency.</li>
              <li><strong>Scheduling</strong> determines how HE kernels are scheduled for each HE operator (e.g.,
                addition, multiplication, rotation, rescale, bootstrapping).</li>
              <li><strong>Decomposing</strong> specifies arithmetic and memory operations on individual ciphertexts for
                HE kernels.</li>
              <li><strong>Binding:</strong> Arithmetic and memory operations are translated into hardware-specific
                programming interfaces (e.g. JAX for TPU), or low-level hardware ISAs (e.g. SIMD ISA for TPU).</li>

          </section>

          <section id="math-foundations">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Mathematical Foundations &amp; Data Representation</h2>
            <p>
              Standard hardware units (like 32-bit CPUs or 8-bit TPU MXUs) cannot natively support thousand-bit
              coefficients. We solve this through <strong>precision lowering</strong> and <strong>tensor
                representation</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Mathematical Basics: Fields and Rings</h3>
            <p>To understand HE from a computation perspective, we look at how numbers are constrained:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Finite Fields (Coefficients):</strong> Each polynomial coefficient is an integer in a finite
                field, meaning there are limited choices of integer values. For example, a modulus $q=14$ gives 14
                choices (0–13). If a value overflows, a modular reduction brings it back into range.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="fig/image11.png" alt="Finite Field Modulus Example">

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Polynomial Rings:</strong> Putting all coefficients together forms a <strong>ring</strong>,
                which has a limited number of degrees. When the degree overflows, a modular reduction by a polynomial
                modulus (e.g., $\Phi(x) = x^{16} + 1$) is used to bring it back.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="fig/image3.png" alt="Polynomial Ring Example">

            <h3>Precision Lowering (thousands to 32 or to 8)</h3>
            <p>Standard hardware cannot process 1000-bit integers directly. We use two mathematical "tricks" to solve
              this:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Residue Number System (RNS):</strong> We break one "giant" polynomial into $L$ smaller
                polynomials called <strong>Limbs</strong> (or Towers). Each limb uses smaller coefficients (e.g., 32-bit
                or 64-bit) that hardware natively supports.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="fig/image9.png" alt="RNS Limbs">

            <ol start="2">
              <li><strong>Digit Decomposition:</strong> For even smaller hardware units (like 8-bit units in a TPU), we
                further break these limbs into "chunks" or "bytes".</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="fig/image1.png" alt="Digit Decomposition">

            <h3>Data Representation (4D or 5D Tensor)</h3>
            <p>
              After lowering the precision using techniques like the <strong>Residue Number System (RNS)</strong>, we
              can represent ciphertext as a multi-dimensional tensor.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>4D Tensor:</strong> Each ciphertext is represented by a 4D vector indexed by {Batch (B),
                Elements (E), Degree (N), Limbs (L)}. In this representation, each specific combination of indices
                specifies a single coefficient.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="fig/image2.png" alt="4D Tensor Representation">

            <ol start="2">
              <li><strong>5D Tensor:</strong> If each individual byte of a coefficient must be explicitly represented
                (for low-precision hardware like 8-bit units), the data becomes a 5D tensor: {Batch (B), Elements (E),
                Degree (N), Limbs (L), Bytes (K)}.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="fig/image5.png" alt="5D Tensor Representation">

            <p>
              All operations do not alter the value of degree, hence we could just hide it in the visualization for
              simplicity. Therefore, we simplify it into representing each limb as a circle, as shown below.
            </p>
            <img src="fig/image4.png" alt="Simplified Limb Representation">

            <h3>Acceleration with NTT</h3>
            <p>
              Multiplying polynomials naively is expensive ($O(N^2)$). We use the <strong>Number-Theoretic Transform
                (NTT)</strong> to transform coefficients into the <strong>evaluation domain</strong>, where
              multiplication becomes element-wise.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Blue Circles:</strong> Represent the <strong>coefficient domain</strong>.</li>
              <li><strong>Red Circles:</strong> Represent the <strong>evaluation domain</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chapter 4: Detailed Computational Flow</h2>
            <p>HE operators require complex sequences of kernels to manage the mathematical properties of the
              ciphertext.</p>

            <h3>HE Multiplication</h3>
            <p>HE multiplication is not a single step; it involves a sequence of four stages to maintain the
              ciphertext's integrity and manage noise:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Rescale:</strong> Adjusts the scale of the fixed-point numbers after multiplication.</li>
              <li><strong>Ciphertext Multiplication:</strong> Multiplies the polynomials, which temporarily increases
                the number of elements (from 2 elements to 3).</li>
              <li><strong>Key Switch (Relinearization):</strong> Converts the 3-element result back into a standard
                2-element ciphertext.</li>
              <li><strong>Basis Conversion (Modulus Down):</strong> Lowers the modulus to manage noise growth.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="fig/image7.png" alt="HE Multiplication Flow">

            <h3>HE Rotation</h3>
            <p>
              HE Rotation moves all data in the slots in the same direction with the same distance. This requires a
              specialized procedure involving <strong>Digit Decomposition</strong>, a <strong>KeySwitch Core</strong>,
              and finally <strong>AutoMorphism</strong> (Degree-wise Shuffling) to physically move the data within the
              polynomial structure.
